The only daughter of the kingdom of Kekaya, she is raised on tales of the gods: how they churned the vast ocean to obtain the nectar of immortality, how they vanquish evil and ensure the land of Bharat prospers, and how they offer powerful boons to the devout and the wise.

Listener\u2019s discretion is advised.<\/p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine<\/i> as \u201cthe greatest epic in the history of comic books\u201d, <i>The Sandman<\/i> changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with Vijay Varma (Morpheus) and Tabu (The Narrator), this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman<\/i> originally re-defined the graphic novel. <\/p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three \u201ctools\u201d that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Neeraj Kabi), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare , and many more. <\/p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Manoj Bajpayee (Doctor Destiny), Sushant Divgikar (Desire), Adarsh Gaurav (John Constantine), Neeraj Kabi (Lucifer), Kubbra Sait (Death) and Tillotama Shome (Calliope), and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Follow Tabu as she leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you\u2019ve never heard anything like this.<\/p>",

But when I agreed to read it for Audible, I had no idea how much work it would be, how intense it would be, and how deeply I would fall in love with it. There were places where I thought 'if I don't give Alexey Alexandrovitch the respect that he deserves in my reading of this scene, a critical part of the book will be ruined. If I don't give EVERYONE the utmost respect and understanding, I'm not doing justice to this brilliantly compassionate book.' But at the same time, I also wanted to have a light touch in the way I played the different characters, so that the magnificence of the novel could shine through. I feel like performing this novel is one of the major accomplishments of my work life - it was so challenging and so deep, a real pleasure.\" (Narrator Maggie Gyllenhaal) <\/p> <p>Leo Tolstoy's classic story of doomed love is one of the most admired novels in world literature. Generations of readers have been enthralled by his magnificent heroine, the unhappily married Anna Karenina, and her tragic affair with dashing Count Vronsky. Maggie Gyllenhaal (<i>The Dark Knight<\/i>, <i>The Honourable Woman<\/i>) cites Tolstoy's epic as one of her favorite books of all time, and her love for the literature permeates her performance. <i>Anna Karenina<\/i> is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In this Audible Exclusive performance by Matt Lucas of <i>Great Expectations<\/i>, Charles Dickens demonstrates that conscience, loyalty and empathy are virtues far more valuable than intellect, wealth and social standing. <\/p> <p>First published in Dickens\u2019 own periodical, <i>All the Year Round<\/i>, the novel was divided into nine monthly instalments, from December 1860 to August 1861. Unsurprisingly, it was an instant success and managed to sell over 100,000 copies per week. Though written at a challenging time in Dickens\u2019 life, when the impending breakdown of his marriage loomed over him, <i>Great Expectations<\/i> proves to be one of his most optimistic, comical and romantic novels. <\/p> <p>This exclusive recording of <i>Great Expectations <\/i>starts with a unique introduction written and narrated by Howard Jacobson, the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>The Finkler Question<\/i>, in which he explains why <i>Great Expectations<\/i> is his favourite Dickens title.  <\/p> <p><b>About the book<\/b> <\/p> <p>Through a rich first-person narrative, listeners are introduced to the character of young Pip as he visits the tombstones of his beloved parents. Unexpectedly confronted by the dark and mysterious Magwitch, a convict in desperate need of food, Pip must decide whether to aid or impede the stranger standing in front of him - a decision which will shape the course of his life. Introducing some of the most iconic, Gothic and comically repulsive literary characters of all time, from the vengeful Miss Havisham, torn apart by a man she once loved, to her beautiful yet seemingly impenetrable ward, Estella, the listener is propelled through a wonderfully Dickensian world. <\/p> <p><b>About the author <\/b><\/p> <p>Much like Pip, Charles Dickens was born into poverty. In his case, it was due to the incarceration of his father, and Dickens was forced to set aside his education in order to work at a nearby factory. Amazingly, this did not deter the young Dickens from rising above his station, and he went on to publish 15 novels, various articles, five novellas and hundreds of short stories. He lectured and campaigned for fair treatment of the lower classes as well as for children\u2019s rights and education. <\/p> <p><b>About the narrator <\/b><\/p> <p>British comedian, actor and screenwriter Matt Lucas is best known for the television show <i>Little Britain<\/i> as well as playing both Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee in <i>Alice in Wonderland<\/i> and his role as Nardole in the 10th series of <i>Doctor Who<\/i>. Able to embody so many characters with just his voice, Lucas is a perfect fit for <i>Great Expectations<\/i>.<\/p>",

In her bright and energetic performance of this British classic, she expertly captures Austen\u2019s signature wit and tone. Her attention to detail, her literary background, and her performance in the 2005 feature film version of the novel provide the perfect foundation from which to convey the story of Elizabeth Bennet, her four sisters, and the inimitable Mr. Darcy. <\/p> <p>In <i>Pride and Prejudice<\/i>, the Bennet sisters try to find their way in the repressive strictures of 19th-century society. Austen shows the folly of judging by first impressions and the experience of falling in love, and she superbly describes a world which, despite being more than two centuries old, still resonates with modern concerns. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>\"Being paid to perform such a gratifying activity as reading Mark Twain aloud felt powerfully akin to Tom Sawyer hoodwinking other boys into paying him for the privilege of whitewashing a fence. Let's keep that between us.\" (Narrator Nick Offerman) <\/p> <p>With <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/i>, not even Twain could have known that when he introduced readers to the inhabitants of the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, he would also be introducing two characters - one a clever and mischievous scamp, and the other a carefree, innocent ragamuffin - whose stories would ultimately shape the course of American literature. But whereas its sequel and companion piece, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/i>, would harken an end to childhood, the story of Tom Sawyer is one that depicts the excitement and adventure of boyhood along the Mississippi. <\/p> <p>Revisit this enduring classic and you will be struck not only by Twain's skill at capturing a time and place so vividly but also by his uncanny ability to crystallize those oftentimes tumultuous and conflicting emotions that a child experiences at the precipice of adulthood: a longing to be free from the rules and obligations of adults while enjoying the laxity inherent in childhood; a love of all things macabre, like blood oaths, cemetery cures, and haunted houses, that reveal a true innocence - an unawareness of real-life consequences and one's own mortality; and the pangs of guilt when knowing the right thing to do and doing the right thing appear to be at odds. <\/p> <p>A natural storyteller and raconteur in his own right - just listen to <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe<\/i> and <i>Gumption<\/i> - actor, comedian, carpenter, and all-around manly man Nick Offerman (<i>Parks and Recreation<\/i>) brings his distinctive baritone and a fine-tuned comic versatility to Twain's writing. In a knockout performance, he doesn't so much as read Twain's words as he does rejoice in them, delighting in the hijinks of Tom - whom he lovingly refers to as a \"great scam artist\" and \"true American hero\" - while deftly delivering the tenderness and care Twain gave to his own characters. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>Exclusively from Audible<\/b> <\/p> <p><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray<\/i> was first published in 1890 in the July edition of the <i>Lippincott Magazine<\/i>. Now, this special anniversary edition marks 50 years since the 1967 Sexual Offences Act was passed in England. 25p from every copy downloaded over the next 12 months will be donated to Stonewall, Britain\u2019s leading LGBT charity, to help the organisation further its work in securing full equality for lesbian, gay, bi and trans people everywhere. <\/p> <p>A damning portrayal of Victorian society, Wilde used his narrative to chastise his contemporaries for their superfluous and hypocritical values. Having also interspersed homoerotic scenes within the story, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray<\/i> was unsurprisingly condemned for its 'indecency', forcing Wilde to publish a second, censored edition in 1891. Wilde defended his vision to the last, whilst simultaneously challenging assumptions about his private life and sexuality. He credited his inspiration for the text to the classic Faustian suggestion that given the chance, a man would undoubtedly sell his soul in exchange for eternal youth. <\/p> <p>When the protagonist, Dorian Gray, meets with the audacious Lord Henry Wotton, he is encouraged to indulge in his most vain and hedonistic of ambitions, thereby testing the boundaries of the law and living a life of unpunished anarchy. As handsome as he is charming, Dorian beguiles those around him, in particular, the artist Basil Hallward. Hopelessly enamoured by the young socialite, Basil sets out to capture his likeness in a full-length portrait. It is the finished product which ultimately engenders Dorian the ultimate weapon; control over the passing of time. <\/p> <p>Modern audiences now recognise <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray<\/i> as an enticing gothic masterpiece and highly astute cautionary tale. Experience the unique and fractured world created by Oscar Wilde in this new audiobook adaptation, made in collaboration with Stonewall and narrated by award-winning actor, Russell Tovey. <\/p> <p><i>Narrator Biography<\/i> <\/p> <p>Russell Tovey is a TV, film and stage actor, known for <i>The History Boys<\/i>, <i>Grabbers<\/i>, <i>Angels in America<\/i>, <i>The Night Manager<\/i>, <i>Pride<\/i>, <i>Quantico<\/i> and <i>The Pass<\/i>. He has narrated many audiobooks throughout his career including, Nick Hornby's <i>High Fidelity<\/i>, Anna Sewell's <i>Black Beauty<\/i> and Mark Michalowski's <i>Being Human<\/i>. <\/p> <p>In collaboration with Stonewall, who are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK, Tovey brings us this new adaption of Oscar Wilde's <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray<\/i>. Having starred in The Old Vic's production of <i>Queers<\/i> and The National Theatre's <i>Angels in America<\/i>, Russell is a keen advocate of LGBT rights and, bringing years of stage training experience, the perfect narrator for this epic tale of masculine beauty. <\/p>",

She has entered, she realises, a parallel existence, which she calls <i>1Q84<\/i> - 'Q' is for 'question mark'. A world that bears a question. <\/p> <p>Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. <\/p> <p>As Aomame's and Tengo's narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector. <\/p> <p>A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell's, <i>1Q84<\/i> is Haruki Murakami's most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers. <\/p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO:<\/b> Audible interviews the translators of <i>1Q84<\/i>, Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>A brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China\u2019s 20th century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu\u2019s <i>Grace of Kings<\/i> and N. K. Jemisin\u2019s Inheritance Trilogy.<\/p> <p>When Rin aced the Keju - the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies - it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn\u2019t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin\u2019s guardians, who believed they\u2019d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard - the most elite military school in Nikan - was even more surprising.<\/p> <p>But surprises aren\u2019t always good.<\/p> <p>Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the South is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power - an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive - and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.<\/p> <p>For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away....<\/p> <p>Rin\u2019s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity...and that it may already be too late.<\/p> <p>R.F. Kuang studies modern Chinese history. She has a BA from Georgetown University and is currently a graduate student in the United Kingdom on a Marshall Scholarship. <i>The Poppy War <\/i>is her debut novel.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>Please note: This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. <\/b><\/p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine<\/i> as \u201cthe greatest epic in the history of comic books\u201d, <i>The Sandman <\/i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times<\/i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split<\/i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman<\/i> originally re-defined the graphic novel. <\/p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three \u201ctools\u201d that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. <\/p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you\u2019ve never heard anything like this.<\/p>",

Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization. <\/p>",

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<\/p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.<\/p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<\/p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<\/p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<\/p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<\/p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:<\/p> <p>Life before death.<\/p> <p>Strength before weakness.<\/p> <p>Journey before destination.<\/p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.<\/p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p>The Cosmere<\/p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Collection:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i> <\/li> <\/ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>A deeply moving memoir about the year that would forever change both a family and a country.<\/b> <\/p> <p>In November 2014, 13 members of the Biden family gathered on Nantucket for Thanksgiving, a tradition they had been celebrating for the past 40 years; it was the one constant in what had become a hectic, scrutinized, and overscheduled life. The Thanksgiving holiday was a much-needed respite, a time to connect, a time to reflect on what the year had brought and what the future might hold. But this year felt different from all those that had come before. Joe and Jill Biden's eldest son, Beau, had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor 15 months earlier, and his survival was uncertain. \"Promise me, Dad,\" Beau had told his father. \"Give me your word that no matter what happens, you're going to be all right.\" Joe Biden gave him his word. <\/p> <p><i>Promise Me, Dad<\/i> chronicles the year that followed, which would be the most momentous and challenging in Joe Biden's extraordinary life and career. Vice President Biden traveled more than a hundred thousand miles that year, across the world, dealing with crises in Ukraine, Central America, and Iraq. When a call came from New York, or Capitol Hill, or Kyiv, or Baghdad - \"Joe, I need your help\" - he responded. For 12 months, while Beau fought for and then lost his life, the vice president balanced the twin imperatives of living up to his responsibilities to his country and his responsibilities to his family. And never far away was the insistent and urgent question of whether he should seek the presidency in 2016. The year brought real triumph and accomplishment, and wrenching pain. But even in the worst times, Biden was able to lean on the strength of his long, deep bonds with his family, on his faith, and on his deepening friendship with the man in the Oval Office, Barack Obama. <\/p> <p>Writing with poignancy and immediacy, Joe Biden allows listeners to feel the urgency of each moment, to experience the days when he felt unable to move forward as well as the days when he felt like he could not afford to stop. This is a book written not just by the vice president but by a father, grandfather, friend, and husband. <i>Promise Me, Dad<\/i> is a story of how family and friendships sustain us and how hope, purpose, and action can guide us through the pain of personal loss into the light of a new future. <\/p> <p><b>Note: this Audible Exclusive includes a powerful interview \u2013 only available here \u2013 between Joe Biden and award-winning journalist, Mike Barnicle. Their discussion contextualizes the memoir\u2019s wide-ranging themes, while also touching upon the presidential election, current events, and what it means to grapple with profound grief.<\/b><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>This novel provides a highly charged examination of human suffering and human sacrifice, private experience and public history, during the French Revolution. <\/p> <p><i>A Tale of Two Cities<\/i> is one of Charles Dickens's most exciting novels. Set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, it tells the story of a family threatened by the terrible events of the past. Doctor Manette was wrongly imprisoned in the Bastille for 18 years without trial by the aristocratic authorities. Finally released, he is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, who despite her French ancestry has been brought up in London. Lucie falls in love with Charles Darnay, another expatriate, who has abandoned wealth and a title in France because of his political convictions. When revolution breaks out in Paris, Darnay returns to the city to help an old family servant, but there he is arrested because of the crimes committed by his relations. His wife, Lucie, their young daughter, and her aged father follow him across the channel, thus putting all their lives in danger.<\/p>",

More confounding is the thick mask of bandages obscuring his face. Why does he disguise himself in this manner and keep himself hidden away in his room? <p>Aroused by trepidation and curiosity, the local villagers bring it upon themselves to find the answers. What they discover is a man trapped in a terror of his own creation, and a chilling reflection of the unsolvable mysteries of their own souls.<\/p> <p>In the tradition of Mary Shelley�s Frankenstein comes another undisputed classic of science fiction and horror to stir the imagination and conscience.<\/p>",
